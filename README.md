### **Part one: Instructions on how to interact with the work**

:books::pencil2: ==How to guide:== 

To interact with 'Modern Dove,' the user needs to press the play button on the bottom left hand corner for the music to start. The audio will match the animation of the dove that plays over 11 seconds before repeating. 


### **Part two: Individual approach**

:music: For this individual component, I have choosen to use the content of three audio tracks to animate my work. 






Inspiration

| ![alt text](ray .png)      | I was inspired by the radiating lines in the shape of an ellipse and adapted this to represent my sun in my artwork.    |[title](https://editor.p5js.org/pattvira/sketches/mutDHiETf)  |
| ![alt text](playbutton.png)      | Took inspiration from Coding Train's tutorial on how to create a play button for p5 JS. I like how it's simple, user-friendly and doesn't distract the viewer from the main artwork.   |[title](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/3Z_lRpu2y)  |

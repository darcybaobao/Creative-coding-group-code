# Creative coding major project 

### **Part one: Instructions on how to interact with the work**

:books::pencil2: ==How to guide==: 

'Modern Dove' is an interactive animation created using p5.js. To interact with this artwork the user will neeed to load the page and the animation autonamtically starts. Next, press the play button on the bottom left hand corner for the music to start. The audio will match the animation of the dove that plays over 80 frames, roughly 11 seconds before repeating. Users will be able to enjoy the visual and auditory journey of my interpretation of daily journey of a flock of doves.


### **Part two: Individual approach**

:notes: For this individual component, I have choosen to use the content of three audio tracks to animate my work. Frame timing is also a significant factor that has been used to animate the backgkground and audio change. 

:girl: There are a few components of the artwork that are animated:

- Sun rays are featured in front of the gradient background, rotating slowly to create a sense of dynamic movement to compliment the flow of the doves. 

- The wings of the doves are programmed to move slowly as they travel across the sky using trigonometric function, more details in the technical explanation section. 

- The flock of doves move horizontally across the screen and loop back to the right side to create a continuous flow of movement to enhance realism. The doves vary in size and are masked by the three different backgrounds, sunrise to in the sky to the beach. 

The main difference between my animation compared to my group members is the use of audio, where as other members focused on mouse interaction with elements, time-based events and colour changes. 





:bulb: Inspiration 

| Image   | Explanation | Reference |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |:-----------: |
| ![alt text](ray .png)      | I was inspired by the radiating lines in the shape of an ellipse and adapted this to represent my sun in my artwork.    |[Link here](https://editor.p5js.org/pattvira/sketches/mutDHiETf)  |
| ![alt text](playbutton.png)      | Took inspiration from Coding Train's tutorial on how to create a play button for p5 JS. I like how it's simple, user-friendly and doesn't distract the viewer from the main artwork.   |[Link here](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/3Z_lRpu2y)  |
